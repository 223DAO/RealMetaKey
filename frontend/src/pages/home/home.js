            <p>Real Meta Key is a tool that enables users to support public goods and crypto brands through stream payments, get NFT as rewards. The special NFT can be used to collect additional rewards such as activation codes.</p>
            <p>Our demo is made for Dark Forest, the on-chain zk-Snarks game which use whitelist keys to allow users to enter the game world. Users can support the Dark Forest officials and tournament organizers by Superfluid, get a key NFT and redeem a real whitelist key (code) by using the NFT.</p>
            <p>Ideally, this tool can be utilized by any public goods and crypto brands, help them reward their long-term supporters more simply and directly by allowing the them to experience their products.</p>
